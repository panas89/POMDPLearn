1. Start a Persistent Container

Run the container without the --rm flag:

docker run -it --name my-ubuntu-container ubuntu:18.04 bash

    --name my-ubuntu-container: Assigns a name to the container (my-ubuntu-container) for easier management later.
    No --rm: Ensures the container persists after you exit.

2. Exit and Re-enter the Persistent Container
To Exit:

Type:

exit

This will stop the container but not remove it.
To Re-enter:

You can reattach to the container using:

docker start -ai my-ubuntu-container

Alternatively, you can open a new shell inside the container:

docker exec -it my-ubuntu-container bash

3. List Containers

To see all containers and their statuses:
Running Containers:

docker ps

All Containers (Including Stopped):

docker ps -a

4. If You Already Used --rm

Unfortunately, a container created with --rm cannot be recovered. You'll need to start a new container:

docker run -it --name my-ubuntu-container ubuntu:18.04 bash

5. Save Changes for Future Use

If you want to save changes (e.g., installed packages) for reuse:

    Commit the container to a new image:

docker commit my-ubuntu-container my-ubuntu-image

Use the new image to create future containers:

    docker run -it my-ubuntu-image bash

Next Steps

    Use --name to give your container a memorable name.
    Avoid --rm if you need to retain your work.
    Optionally, use volumes to persist specific data between sessions:

    docker run -it -v /path/to/local/folder:/workspace ubuntu:18.04 bash

To reload an existing container and get back into it, follow these simple steps:
1. Find the Container

List all containers, including stopped ones:

docker ps -a

    Look for the CONTAINER ID or NAME of the container you want to reload.

2. Start the Container

If the container is stopped, start it:

docker start <container_id_or_name>

3. Reattach to the Container

Re-enter the container's terminal session:

docker attach <container_id_or_name>

    This reconnects you to the same terminal session you left.

4. Start a New Shell (Alternative)

If you want a new shell session inside the container:

docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> bash

5. Verify the Container is Running

Check running containers to confirm:

docker ps
